* Bazel rules for Emacs Lisp

This repository provides a [[https://bazel.build/][Bazel]] integration for
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Emacs Lisp]].  It
is modeled after the rules definitions for other languages, like the
[[https://docs.bazel.build/be/c-cpp.html][C++ rules]].

This is not an officially supported Google product.

** Usage

Add a snippet like the following to your Bazel `WORKSPACE` file:

#+BEGIN_SRC bazel-workspace
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "phst_rules_elisp",
    sha256 = "b9fa0a049a915bf46063df8c80b2610518b686b5a78a0d93d75120f67902a76d",
    strip_prefix = "rules_elisp-1dfe72da00da45427fa2e68485129b044a4a7621",
    urls = [
        "https://github.com/phst/rules_elisp/archive/1dfe72da00da45427fa2e68485129b044a4a7621.zip",  # 2022-02-16
    ],
)

load(
    "@phst_rules_elisp//elisp:repositories.bzl",
    "rules_elisp_dependencies",
    "rules_elisp_toolchains",
)

rules_elisp_dependencies()

rules_elisp_toolchains()
#+END_SRC

Then you can use the ~elisp_library~, ~elisp_binary~, and ~elisp_test~ rules.
See the [[file:elisp.org][generated documentation]] and the examples in the
~examples~ directory for details.

** Load path management

The Emacs Lisp rules by default only add the workspace root directories to the
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][load
path]].  However, many Emacs Lisp libraries assume that their immediate parent
directory is present in the load path.  To support such libraries, the
~elisp_library~ rule supports an optional ~load_path~ attribute.  You can
specify additional load path directories using this attribute.  Relative
directories are relative to the Bazel package directory; absolute directories
are relative to the workspace root.  A typical use case is to specify
~load_path = ["."]~ to add the current package to the load path.

** Runfiles

This repository also includes a library to access
[[https://docs.bazel.build/skylark/rules.html#runfiles][runfiles]].  To use it,
add a build dependency on ~@phst_rules_elisp//elisp/runfiles~.  See the header
comments in ~runfiles.el~ for further usage hints.
