;; Unit test for lib-1.el.

;;; Code:

(require 'examples/lib-1)

(require 'ert)
(require 'ert-x)

(ert-deftest lib-1-test ()
  (should (equal (lib-1-func) "hi from lib-1")))

(ert-deftest lib-1-broken-test ()
  ;; This test is broken, but Bazel will skip it due to the “skip_tests”
  ;; attribute in the build rule.
  (should (= 0 1)))

(ert-deftest lib-1-resource ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents (ert-resource-file "test.txt"))
    (should (equal (buffer-string) "hi from ERT resource\n"))))

(declare-function ert-resource-file "ert-x" (file))

;;; lib-1-test.el ends here
