tests like `ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit`.

You can restrict the tests to be run using the `--test_filter` option.  If set,
the value of `--test_filter` must be a Lisp expression usable as an
ERT test selector; see [Test Selectors](<info:ert#Test Selectors>).
You can also restrict the tests to be run using the `skip_tests` and
`skip_tags` rule attributes.  These restrictions are additive, i.e., a test
only runs if it’s not suppressed by either facility.

In coverage mode (i.e., when run under `bazel coverage`), all tests tagged with
the `:nocover` tag are also skipped.  You can use this tag to skip tests that
normally pass, but don’t work under coverage for some reason.

Test files can access additional command-line arguments passed via the `args`
attribute or the `--test_arg` Bazel option via the `command-line-args-left`
variable.  After processing known arguments, test files must remove them from
`command-line-args-left` so that it’s empty after all test files are loaded.
