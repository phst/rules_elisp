;;; Commentary:

;; Byte-compiles a single Emacs Lisp file.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   emacs --quick --batch --load=compile.el SOURCE DEST
;;
;; Compiles the Emacs Lisp file SOURCE and stores the compiled output in the
;; file DEST.  Exits with a zero status only if compilation succeeds.

;;; Code:

(require 'bytecomp)
(require 'warnings)

(defvar elisp/current-repository)

             (cons "--fatal-warnings" #'elisp/fatal-warnings))
