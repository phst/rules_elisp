;;; Commentary:

;; Example functions to test coverage reporting.  This has to be in a separate
;; file because the test runner only instruments newly-loaded files.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'subr-x)

(defun tests/test-function (arg)
  ;; The condition and the two branches should be on separate lines, for line
  ;; coverage testing.
  (if
      arg
      (message "Foo")
    (message "Bar"))
  (if
      (not arg)
      (message "Bar")
    (message "Foo"))
  ;; Multiple local functions with the same name should work.
  (cl-flet ((foo () 1))
    (message "%d" (foo)))
  (cl-flet ((foo () 2))
    (message "%d" (foo)))
  ;; More branch coverage examples.
  (message "%S"
           (cond
            (arg)
            ((or (eq arg 'foo) (and (not arg) 77) (memq arg '(1 2 3))) arg)
            ((not arg))
            ((and (not arg) 123) arg)))
  (condition-case nil
      (message "%S" arg)
    (error arg))
  (when-let (a arg) (message "%s" a))
  (when-let ((a arg) (arg) a) (message "%s" a))
  (cl-loop for x in '(1 2 3) if x do (message "%s" x))
  ;; Improper lists and vectors should also work.
  (message "%S %S %S" `(,arg . q) #1='(a . #1#) `[,arg q])
  (ignore-errors
    (error "Boo")))
